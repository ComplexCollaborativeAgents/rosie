evaluation: modifiers/fill 

Aaron Mininger

This is a variation on the fill task from blending2, 
where the goal is to fill a cup with water using a water cooler. 
Here, we use an until clause on the press action to act like an action model
and allow the agent to learn a complete policy, even though 
it has no innate action model for the button.
