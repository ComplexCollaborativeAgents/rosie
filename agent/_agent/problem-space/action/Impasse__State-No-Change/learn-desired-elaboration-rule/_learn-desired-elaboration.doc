######################### learn-desired-elaboration #####################

Will try to learn an elaboration rule to elaborate the action's goal (desired)


##### State Rep ######

action-operator     - The action we're learing the goal for, elaborated from superstate
goal-id             - The smem goal info - elaborated from superstate.action-id.goal
procedural-id       - The action's procedural smem info - elaborated from superstate.action-id.procedural
world               - Elaborated from superstate.world


##### ground-argument ######

Elaborates the goal-id onto the state inside a ground-argument predicate-set:
  (<s> ^ground-argument <arg>)
  (<arg> ^arg-type predicate-set
         ^generalized-rep <gid>)

This will trigger ground-argument rules to fire (see action/state-elaborations/ground-argument)
  Which will match the smem rep of the goal against the world and action-operator
  To produce a instance of the goal, elaborated to the state as ^desired


##### Operators #####

create-empty-goal - If the goal can't be fully grounded, this copies an empty desired to the superstate 
  (no chunk is learned)

complete-learn-desired-elaboration-rule - If the entire goal is grounded, this copies it to the superstate
  and a chunk is learned
