####################### generalize-action ############################
These rules take an instance of an action (an action-operator) 
and generalize it into a semantic memory representation that can be stored

They fire if the following structure is on the state:
(state <s> ^generalize-action <ga>
           ^generalize-info <info>)
(<ga> ^source-action <src>       # The action operator to generalize
      ^source-id <src-id>        # The root smem LTI for the action to generalize
(<info> ^reference-action <ref>  # These 'references' determine the structure to use when connecting slots
        ^reference-id <ref-id>)  # That is, the slot LTI's will come from the reference-id (from action-id.procedural)
                                 # The source and reference actions can be the same if desired
      
####################### generalize-argument ###########################
#
# These rules take a specific instance of an action argument
#   and generates a generalized-rep to be stored in smem
#
# They fire if a generalize-argument structure is on the state
#   (state <s> ^generalize-argument <gen-arg>)
#   (<gen-arg> ^instance <i>)  # usually from the action operator

# These also expect the generalize-info structure to be on the state
# (They use the reference-action and reference-id)
