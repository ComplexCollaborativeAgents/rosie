Aaron - Notes about things to still do/fix in Rosie

TODO: 

- magicbot doesn't check object stability

- look into: Should we match new perception objects against all non-visible objects or take into account their belief object places

- Fix which predicates are extracted, maybe sync with James? 
  Including making sure predicates are good in the magicbot domain

- Make sure tabletop arm and object tracking is ok, and how we hande perception of moving objects and don't delete

- when moving objects, keeping the belief bounds in check
# Send the command to svs
#sp {anystate*apply*change-world-state*update-object-pose*svs*copy_node*grabbed
#   (state <s> ^operator <o>
#              ^top-state.svs.command <cmd>)
#   (<o> ^name change-world-state
#        ^update-object-pose <obj-info>)
#   (<obj-info> ^belief-obj.id <bel-id>
#               ^world-obj.predicates.is-grabbed1 grabbed1)

- Put Down with things other than on or in

- Handling explore failure in a find task (or failures in general)

- Generalizing/Instantiating Objects and which predicates to use

- Reduce the volume of information printed for reference-info category LTI's 

To Refactor:
- output-link status values
- outgoing messages and types
