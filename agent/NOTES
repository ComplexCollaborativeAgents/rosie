  Including making sure predicates are good in the magicbot domain

- game-learning/find-solution - change arm.grabbed

- visual/non-visual properties, fix this



### Details

# Detect Discrepancies

different-arm-status: grabbed predicate != perception
different-object-status: predicates reachable, visible != perception
different-object-predicate: other predicates from perception
different-robot-status: robot status predicate
different-waypoint: current-waypoint != input-link

grown-object: vol diff exceeds threshold
shrunken-object: vol diff exceeds threshold (not occuded)
moved-object: pos diff exceeds threshold

missing-object: in-view=true, occluded=false, visible=false
new-belief-object: new-belief-object flag
new-perception-object: input-link-obj w/o perception-obj

# Construct World Object
Retrieve root-category from smem and copy all supercategories onto the object
Include all 'intrinsic' predicates (non-status)
