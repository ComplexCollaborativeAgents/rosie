TODO: 

- magicbot doesn't check object stability

- look into: Should we match new perception objects against all non-visible objects or take into account their belief object places

- Fix which predicates are extracted, maybe sync with James? 
  Including making sure predicates are good in the magicbot domain

- game-learning/find-solution - change arm.grabbed

- Make sure tabletop arm and object tracking is ok, and how we hande perception of moving objects and don't delete

- when moving objects, keeping the belief bounds in check

- Handle task-objects better, including how we delete them

- Put Down with things other than on or in

- Can we make all manipulation actions (open, turn-on) require an empty gripper?

- Refactor output-link status enum

- Refactor outgoing messages

- Don't pick up objects that are held by another person?

- Handling explore failure in a find task (or failures in general)
