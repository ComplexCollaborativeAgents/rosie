######################### state-elaborations ######################

A collection of different elaboration rules used in the action problem-space

## task-concept-network - the TCN of the current task (matches task-operator.task-handle)
   Will query smem if it is not there

## task-operator - the operator represenation of the current task being performed
   Will copy from superstate, includes rules to deep copy

## desired - Will elaborate the task goal (desired) with ^satisfied true if satisfied in the world

## generalize-task-argument - Takes a working memory representation of an argument (from an task-operator)
   And generates a semantic memory representation

## instantiate-task-argument Takes a semantic memory representation of an argument
   And generates an instance of it, matched against the world and task-operator

## match-task-operator - Used to match a task-operator against a set of proposed tasks

## until-clause - If there is an until clause on the state, 
  Will check it against the world and elaborate ^satisfied true if it is satisfied
