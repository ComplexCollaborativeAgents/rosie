####################### ground-action ###########################
#
# These rules take a general representation of an action (from smem)
# And generate a grounded instance with connections to the world/task
#
# They fire if the following structures are on the state:
#(state <s> ^ground-action <ga>
#           ^grounding-info <info>)
#(<ga> ^source-id <src-id>        # The root smem LTI of the action to ground 
#(<info> ^reference-action <ref>  # These 'references' determine the structure to use when connecting slots
#        ^reference-id <ref-id>)  # That is, the slot LTI's will come from the reference-id (from action-id.procedural)
#                                 # The source and reference action LTI's can be the same if desired
                                 
# Also expects the world to be on the state

####################### ground-argument ###########################
#
# These rules take a general representatino of an action argument (from smem)
# And generate a grounded instance with connections to world/task
#
# They fire if a ground-argument structure is on the state
#   (state <s> ^ground-argument <gr-arg>)
#   (<gr-arg> ^generalized-rep <rep>)  # usually from the procedural id 

# These also expect the world and grounding-info described above
