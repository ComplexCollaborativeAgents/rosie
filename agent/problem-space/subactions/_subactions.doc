# general rules that have to deal with representing the subactions in substates

problem-space.subactions
	^copy-type << deep shallow >>
		Whether the subactions copy is shallow (elaborates the same identifier)
			or deep (all substructure is deep copied)
	^source <subactions>
		The subactions to copy, if none is specified it defaults to superstate.subactions
		
deep-copy-subactions
	A structure created when the copy-type is deep
	Contains the following:
	
	source - the source subactions to copy from
	copy - the new subactions rep being deep copied (elaborated to state.subactions)
	copy-subactions-map - structure used to deep copy each subaction
		entry
			source <src-sub> The source object to copy 
			copy <new-sub>   The newly created copy of that subaction
