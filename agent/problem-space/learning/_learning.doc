# general rules that define how learning is done in the substate

problem-space.learning
	type - the type of learning being done
		includes << retrospective exploration >>
		This is by default copied from the superstate.problem-space.learning.type unless a different type is there
	use chunking - if there, chunking is turned on on the state
	
	
Learning Types:

## retrospective [see type-retrospective]
	The problem-space is for retrospective learning
	The agent internally simulates the subactions and tries to reach the goal
		If successful, it will learn preference rules for when to prefer those subactions
		
## exploration [see type-exploration]
	The problem-space is for learning due to exploration search
	The agent searches for a way to get to the goal, 
		and if successful it will propose that action next
